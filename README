== Yet another deployment utility

But why? Well, Capistrano was bloated for our use-cases, to much stuff bolted on. Inploy looked really interesting, but does not have multistage support from what I could tell. So I did what any reasonable developer would do and befell to the "Not Invented here syndrome". 

Top Design goals, ideas:
 
  - deploy is just a push to another remote. all that must be done is triggered by pre and post receveie git hooks.
  - initial setup done by ruby script
  - extensible recipe system, so you can plug in and out what you need and easily roll your own recipes

== Usage

Setup a project with

 blazing init

Then edit your config/blazing.rb file.

If you are ready to do your first deploy, run 

 blazing setup <target_name>

Afterwards you can just deploy with

  blazing deploy <target_name>

Or just use

  git push <target_name>

which does basically the same
