== Yet another deployment utility

But why? Well, Capistrano was bloated for our use-cases, to much stuff bolted on. Inploy looked really interesting, but does not have multistage support from what I could tell. So I did what any reasonable developer would do and befell to the "Not Invented here syndrome". 

Top Design goals, ideas:
 
  - deploy is just a push to another remote. all that must be done is triggered by pre and post receveie git hooks.
  - initial setup done by ruby script
  - the stuff that gets executed is defined in recipes, which are handled kind of like chef recipes with vendor branches

Also, I just wanted to play around with instance_eval and such :-)
