Blazing fast and painless git push deploys
==========================================

*Oh no, yet another deployer!*

Not everyone can or wants to deploy on heroku. But now you can have the same (well, almost the same, since we're not gonna patch SSH) awesomely smooth git push deploys on whatever server you have SSH access to. Blazing helps you to create and distribute your post-receive hooks, which are executed on the remote server after you successfully pushed to it. It also helps you to easily set up remote repositories for deploying to, is extendable by simple rake tasks and is configured by a nice DSL.

Quickstart
----------

`blazing init`, edit your blazing config, run `blazing setup [target]` to deploy your post-receive hook and you're set. Deploy with `git push <target> <branch>`.

Features
--------

Out of the box, blazing can do the following:

* **uses ruby, but works for deploying pretty much anything else just as well**
* set up a repository you can push to for deployment
* set up a git post-receive hook, configurable by a simple DSL
* works with rvm/rbenv/chruby(and probably others)
* allows you to run custom rake tasks during deployment

Overview & Background
---------------------

Blazing is a deployment tool written in Ruby. It provides helpers to setup your project with a git post-receive hook, which is triggered every time you push to your production repository.

I initially started working on an extension to capistrano which would cover most of my needs and the nees of my team. After a short while I noticed that bolting more functionality on top of capistrano was just going to be messy (and a PTA to maintain). We were alerady using tons of own recipes and customizations, capistrano multistage, capistrano-ext, etc.

I had a look at what others were doing and after a round of trying around and not getting what I wanted, I started this.

#### Design Goals

When I started working on blazing, I had some design goals in mind which I think should stay relevant for this project:

- it must be well tested
- it must stay robust, simple and with small code base with as few moving parts as possible. Minimum code in the main project, extensions live outside.
- no messy rake scripts: Define the desired behavior trough a DSL, and extensions add to this DSL in a clean and modular way
- Deployments should be fast

#### Inspiration & Alternatives

I looked at [Inploy](https://github.com/dcrec1/inploy) and [Vlad](https://github.com/seattlerb/vlad) after having used [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) for several
years. Then got inspired by defunkt's
[blog post](https://github.com/blog/470-deployment-script-spring-cleaning) about deployment script spring cleaning. Other's doing a similar thing with git push deployments are Mislav's [git-deploy](https://github.com/mislav/git-deploy) (which was a great inspiration and resource) and [pushand](https://github.com/remi/pushand.git) by remi. If you don't like blazing, you might give them a try.

Usage
-----

#### Installation

Your machine should be setup with ruby, rubygems, bundler and git. Install blazing by adding it to your `Gemfile` or run `gem install blazing`. The basic assumption from now on will be that you are working on a project with bundler and a Gemfile. Support for other ways to handle dependencies might be added in the future but **at the moment bundler is required**.

#### blazing Commands

##### `blazing init`

Generate a blazing config file

##### `blazing setup <target>`

Setup target repository for deployment and add git remote localy. Use 'all' as target name to update all configured targets at once.

##### `blazing update <target>`

Update post-receive hook according to current config. Run it after changing the blazing config. Use 'all' as target name to update all configured targets at once.

#### Configuration (blazing DSL)

```ruby
# Sample target definition:
#
#   target <target_name>, <target_location>, [options]
#
# The options provided in the target definition will override any
# options provided in the recipe call.
#
# Options recognized by blazing core:
#   rails_env: used when calling the rake task after deployment

target :staging, 'user@server:/var/www/someproject.com',
       :rails_env => 'production'

# Sample rvm/rbenv/chruby/other setup:
#
#    env_sript <your rvm setup scripts>
#
# Setting an env_script path makes sure it is sourced before the hook
# does anything at all. That way you can setup any environment things
# you need to. Most commonly this will be sourcing rvm and setting a
# ruby, or doing something with rbenv or chruby.
env_script '/etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh'

# Sample rake file config:
#
#     rake <task>, [environment variables]
#
# The provided rake task will be run after blazing has done its stuff.
# Note: you can only call a single rake task. If you need to run several
# tasks just create one task that wrapps all the others.

rake :post_deploy, 'RAILS_ENV=production'
```

#### Deploying

Just push to your remoteâ€¦ so if you set up a target named `production`, use `git push production master` to deploy your master branch there.
